15. I share my computations such that they can be sensed (seen) by others who also seem to compute. I know this because I have a limited but useful model of what they are and what they do, and when I contrast it to my model of myself, I realize they also compute.
16. The probability of my existence and act of computation of 'laws of physics' is, based on computations of probability done by others and that I studied (sense) is infinitesimal but not zero.
17. Everything that is possible must happen, is inevitable.
18. By 10. and 11. My computation of the 'laws of physics' is physically inevitable even if quasi-infinitely improbable.
