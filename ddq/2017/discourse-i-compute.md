# Summary

Computation justifies itslef. What differentiates a computation form another is _choice_, rooted ultimately in the _mother cmputer_: the universe.

1. I compute because it is possible for me to physically exist and compute.
2. It is pointless to compute that I can compute (to formalize why I can compute) because the fact that I can compute justifies itself.
3. My ability to compute is a sequential process.
4. It matters not if I compute non-sense or not, contradiction or not, mathematics or not. Whatever I compute is computable.
5. If I so wish, I may compute rules and formalisms. To bootstrap them, I must choose a subset of actions I do for at least one of the symbols of the language, so that I can, when I compute, manipulate the formalism, compute with it.
6. Mathematics happens by computing of the kind mentioned in 5. Hence, it is predicated on the possibility of computation, which by 1. is possible because it happens and for no other real reason.
7. I can compute a formalism that abstracts the way I compute, but that again is predicated on 1. It cannot be used to justify 1, but it can be used to model it.
8. By 5. and 6. Mathematics is inescapably bootstrapped by semantic atom. This cannot be circumvented by basing it on a formal model of computation, because that itself, by 5. is bootstrapped by that same semantic atom.
9. By 8., when formalizing mathematics, per example, on a non-human computer, I must achieve a similar bootstrapping, otherwise 'nothing happens', the formal language is 'dead' since it cannot be manipulated.
10. This is easy though. The non-human machine exactly like me in 1., can compute because it is possible for it to exist and compute (this includes the possibility of it to consistently compute in a deterministic way).
11. By the choice in which I build the machine, it will have some form of intrinsic computing capability that will be used to bootstrap the formal system. Canonically, the simplest such capability is the the ability to concatenate bits. This is also called 'counting'. Everything follows from that.
12. Since everything follows from that, every sequence of computation can be attached to counting. What differentiates every such computation is what it attaches to the 1, to 2, and so on. The essential component of this difference (also called algorithm) is choice. The choice of algorithm.
13. The choice of algorithm is bootstrapped again by the possibility to exist and compute a finite sequence of symbols, symbols that are linked to the bootstrapping of the computer (human or not), allowing it to manipulate them.
14. By 13., the process as a whole of all computers (human or not) computing is hence inevitable, a computation which contains choice when seen from the point of view of the 'leaf' computer computing it, the choice of algorithm for it coming from a 'mother' computer, and so on, until the root computer is reached: the universe providing the possibility of computing, where all choices have been turned into inevitabilities.
