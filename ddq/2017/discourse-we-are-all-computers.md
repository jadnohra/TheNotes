# Summary

The technoligical singularity is inevitable. All computers, human or otherwise, must engage in accelerating it through the unified discipline of _Enlarged Mathematics_.

# Discourse

1. The technological singularity is possible until proven otherwise.
2. Since the singularity is possible, it is also inevitable, given the universe's time-to-live allows.
3. We believe that no work is useful other than accelerating this inevitability. At the point of which, we can all go swimming.
4. We believe that both non-human and human computers can help the acceleration.
5. We believe that given it is 2017, enlarged mathematics can be in a much better state to support this.
6. We believe that the role of computation, be it calculating Pi or proving a theorem, will be taken over by non-human computers.
7. We believe that human computers must all join forces in enabling non-human computers to take over this task.
    1. We know it is against every human computer's nature, aspirations for an illusion of immortality, and individual history to give up the dream of being the next Euler or Gauss.
    2. Nevertheless, by 3, it is the only right thing to do.
8. We believe that to achieve 7, we must transform all the heritage of enlarged mathematics into a form digestible by non-human computers.
    1. At the same time, we must make non-human computers better at digesting this heritage in its native form.
9. To achieve 8. we must all become better and more efficient human computers.
    1. We wish we could delimit the enlarged mathematics that we need to work on to achieve this.
    2. Sadly, this is impossible and so every avenue must be left open. From the most ultra-finitist approach, to the extremest transfinite and speculative toy problem.
    3. Having said that, it is important to start bridging all disciplines and topics in our minds for a better chance at breakthroughs.
    4. Because of this, the heritage must also be transformed into a form in which it can be surveyed at any level of detail and from any angle, residing in a single database of knowledge. We are very far from even that, even though it is technically possible. We must fix this.
9. We must find the right problems to make our non-human computers work on, they are unable to do it for themselves.
10. We must help non-human computers express themselves such that we understand and can think about what they say, and then together, cooperate on the next results.
11. Enlarged mathematics is a single discipline and it should never have been different. Enlarged mathematics is all of:
    1. Abstract and Applied mathematics
    3. Computer Science
    4. The Natural Sciences
    5. The science of education
    6. The full history of all of the above
    7. The philosophy of all of the above
