Dear Mathematics, Physics, Logic and Science in general. Forgive me for these weak ramblings of an idiot mind. I have hidden them for years, but maybe they serve better exposed, as a beacon for other idiot minds, as a sign of the ordinary intellect's incapability to ascend to higher levels of understanding, or at the very least, as ridicuoulously lame entertainment.
