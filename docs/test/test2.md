# The Nature of 'Understanding'

* Ten years ago, I decided I will secretly embark on a journey to 'truly understand' mathematics, as a rebellious naive challenge to the well known warning: "Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them." and tell no one about it until I have a result.
* Two years ago, I showed the work in progress of this work to a person how asked me to mentor them in mathematics, that person's comment was that this would be a game changer and a holy grail if it works.
* Two years ago, I stopped worked on that project which swallowed every minute of my free time for 5 years in a row.

I embarked on this journey because something burns inside my, and inside so many people I talk to. **We go through our education, we graduate, and still we feel that did not 'really' understand anything**. If I would have summarize my failed journey in this regard, I would note:
* At the start, I tried to find in the literature (Philosophy and Pedagogy) or through introspection, what 'understanding' really means. The results were inconclusive, but my opinion after around a year of reading and thinking was:
  - From the inside, understanding boils down to familiarity, and not much more
  - From the outside, understanding boils down to ability to use the topic to a certain advantage, and not much more 
* I have a curse, and I do not know if it's by nature (simply how my brain is wired) or nurture (STEM is about understanding and not about memorizing) or both, but my brain loves to memorize relationships, but hates to memorize 'data'. For example, 'matrices are a represenation of linear maps', or 'the proof of square root of 2 being irrational is only possibly by contradition', are relationships. But the details of the fundamental theorem of calculus are data, and that June is the 6th month (Yes I have to count every time) is data.
* The more I read about my mathematical heroes such as Lagrange, Leibniz, Poincare, Huygens and others, the more it became clear to me that: Outliers such as these humans, have both capabilities in spades. 'Thinking', that is: navigating through relationships in order to solve problems at speed, as well as 'Memory' for both data and relationships, and a lot of it. 
  - To exhibit understanding 'from the outside', time is often of the essence. A good thinker with bad memory immediatly faces insurmountable obstacles, because they need to refer and search within books, notes and other artifacts, for the details of 'data' or 'relations' they know exist but cannot recover directly into working memory as they work on a problem. And so being a good thinker is not enough. An outlier like the heroes mentioned is a good thinker equipped with a really huge bank of facts that they can access directly from memory. 
  - Due to the above, these ouliers have the ability to solve a much larger number of problems that a mere 'good thinker'.
